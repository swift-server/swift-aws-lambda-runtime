# Hello World 

This is a simple example of an AWS Lambda function that takes a `String` as input parameter and returns a `String` as response.

## Code 

The code creates a `LambdaRuntime` struct. In it's simplest form, the initializer takes a function as argument. The function is the handler that will be invoked when an event triggers the Lambda function.

The handler is `(event: String, context: LambdaContext)`. The function takes two arguments:
- the event argument is a `String`. It is the parameter passed when invoking the function.
- the context argument is a `Lambda Context`. It is a description of the runtime context.

The function return value will be encoded as your Lambda function response.

## Test locally 

You can test your function locally before deploying it to AWS Lambda.

To start the local function, type the following commands:

```bash
swift run
```

It will compile your code and start the local server. You know the local server is ready to accept connections when you see this message.

```txt
Building for debugging...
[1/1] Write swift-version--644A47CB88185983.txt
Build of product 'MyLambda' complete! (0.31s)
2025-01-29T12:44:48+0100 info LocalServer : host="127.0.0.1" port=7000 [AWSLambdaRuntimeCore] Server started and listening
```

Then, from another Terminal, send your payload with `curl`. Note that the payload must be a valid JSON string. In the case of this function that accepts a simple String, it means the String must be wrapped in between double quotes.

```bash
curl -d '"seb"' http://127.0.0.1:7000/invoke    
"Hello seb"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The local server is only available in `DEBUG` mode. It will not start with `swift -c release run`.

## Build & Package 

To build & archive the package, type the following commands.

```bash
swift build
swift package archive --allow-network-connections docker
```

If there is no error, there is a ZIP file ready to deploy. 
The ZIP file is located at `.build/plugins/AWSLambdaPackager/outputs/AWSLambdaPackager/MyLambda/MyLambda.zip`

## Deploy

Here is how to deploy using the `aws` command line.

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
--function-name MyLambda \
--zip-file fileb://.build/plugins/AWSLambdaPackager/outputs/AWSLambdaPackager/MyLambda/MyLambda.zip \
--runtime provided.al2 \
--handler provided  \
--architectures arm64 \
--role arn:aws:iam::<YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID>:role/lambda_basic_execution
```

The `--architectures` flag is only required when you build the binary on an Apple Silicon machine (Apple M1 or more recent). It defaults to `x64`.

Be sure to replace <YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID> with your actual AWS account ID (for example: 012345678901).

## Invoke your Lambda function

To invoke the Lambda function, use this `aws` command line.

```bash
aws lambda invoke \
--function-name MyLambda \
--payload $(echo \"Seb\" | base64)  \
out.txt && cat out.txt && rm out.txt
```

Note that the payload is expected to be a valid JSON string, hence the surroundings quotes (`"`).

This should output the following result. 

```
{
    "StatusCode": 200,
    "ExecutedVersion": "$LATEST"
}
"Hello Seb"
```

## Undeploy

When done testing, you can delete the Lambda function with this command.

```bash
aws lambda delete-function --function-name MyLambda
```
