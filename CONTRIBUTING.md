## How to submit a bug report

Please ensure to specify the following:

* SwiftAWSLambdaRuntime commit hash
* Contextual information (e.g. what you were trying to achieve with SwiftAWSLambdaRuntime)
* Simplest possible steps to reproduce
  * More complex the steps are, lower the priority will be.
  * A pull request with failing test case is preferred, but it's just fine to paste the test case into the issue description.
* Anything that might be relevant in your opinion, such as:
  * Swift version or the output of `swift --version`
  * OS version and the output of `uname -a`
  * Network configuration


### Example

```
SwiftAWSLambdaRuntime commit hash: 22ec043dc9d24bb011b47ece4f9ee97ee5be2757

Context:

1. ...
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...

$ swift --version
Swift version 4.0.2 (swift-4.0.2-RELEASE)

## Writing a Patch

A good SwiftAWSLambdaRuntime patch is:

1. Concise, and contains as few changes as needed to achieve the end result.
2. Tested, ensuring that any tests provided failed before the patch and pass after it.
3. Documented, adding API documentation as needed to cover new functions and properties.
4. Accompanied by a great commit message, using our commit message template.

### Commit Message Template

We require that your commit messages match our template. The easiest way to do that is to get git to help you by explicitly using the template. To do that, `cd` to the root of our repository and run:

    git config commit.template dev/git.commit.template
